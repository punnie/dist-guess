Ever found yourself in a linux system wondering which distro is running? Tired to search here, there, and every fucking where for the right release file?

This simple tool will, in time, enable you to easily find that information. Just type in a terminal:

bc. bash <(curl http://tinyurl.com/dist-guess)

h2. Attribution

The basis for this was stolen from a forum somewhere in the internet which location has been lost in the bottomless pit of time. A reference to the original author will be appended to this file as soon as I, or anyone knowlegeable, find the guy.
